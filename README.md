The Mippits
===========

Flexible [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set) interpreter with support for the [CS241](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/) MIPS instruction subset.

Rationale
---------

CS241 at the University of Waterloo, "Foundations of Sequential Programs", provides various tools for working with MIPS executables. These are necessary for assignments and coursework. However, they are strongly coupled with the student Linux environment, which makes it very difficult to work offline.

Plus, the debugging support sucks when something goes wrong.

Usage
